# sbmt-electron
 A rework of [starboundmodtester](https://github.com/PistolRcks/starboundmodtester) using Electron, React and MUI

## Features
Currently, this only builds and runs a singular mod, but the framework is there for building multiple mods. I'll work on it later (tm).
It also currently isn't very robust, as errors will not be shown on the frontend (e.g. if you select an incorrect folder for a mod or Starbound).

## Main Packages
```
electron
react
@mui/material
esbuild
@electron-forge/cli
```
